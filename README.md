#  Fitness Tracking System (C++)

This is a simple C++ console app that lets users track their fitness data — like steps walked, calories burned, and heart rate — all stored securely for later use. It’s a great project to practice object-oriented programming, file handling, and basic data management in C++.

##  What You Can Do

* **Create a profile** – Add your name, age, weight, and gender.
* **Log your fitness stats** – Keep track of your daily steps, calories, and heart rate.
* **Save and load data** – Your data is saved between sessions using file storage.
* **Login system** – Secure your info with a basic username and password setup.
* **View progress** – See summaries and simple reports of your fitness activity.
